Aria - Personal Voice Assistant
Description of the user's instructions:
When you open the program, the first window is the main window. On the left side, you can see a large text field – a screen for displaying information and visual dialogue with the voice assistant. The text field is not editable, so the user cannot edit, copy, or paste any text with their own hands. the text on the screen is only programmatically edited.
Below the text field is a text feed-this is where you can enter the user's query as text. The user enters the desired command using the keyboard.
Along with the text feed, there is a small white button with a black arrow-the input button. When a user has entered their message in the text feed, they can send their message to the program for processing.to do this, press the enter button or use the "hot" key and press "return" ("Enter"). After clicking the button, the text feed is automatically cleared of text, and a message written by the user appears on the screen of the text field.
Below the text feed is a button with an image of a microphone-a voice input button. After clicking the button, the user must say their command. The command recording ends automatically if the user does not speak clear words for some time. If the user's request was not clear or the user did not clearly say their command, the voice assistant will inform you about the request to repeat the request. When recording is complete, the command will be displayed on the text field screen, and the voice assistant will immediately start processing the information. You can also use the "down" hotkey to write a command.
On the right side of the app, you can see twelve buttons – these are quick query buttons, that is, you do not need to enter text or speak a voice message for certain commands that are represented on these buttons. Each button is responsible for its own command, if you click any of them, the information from the pressed button will be transmitted to the voice assistant for processing, and the request itself will be displayed on the screen of the text field. Available commands for quick query buttons:
• "Make a note" – make a note;
